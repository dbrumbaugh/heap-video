Introduction to Binary Heaps

Applications:
    • Priority Queues 
    • Sorting (Heap Sort)
    • Sorted Array Merging

Definition:
    A heap is a tree that satisfies the "Heap Property"

    Every vertex in the tree is smaller (or larger)
    than its children.

Abstract Data Type:
    • Insert a new element
    • Remove the root node (min/max element)
    • Check if empty

Complete Binary Tree
    A binary tree (max 2 children for each vertex) where nodes
    are always inserted from the last level, going left-to-right

Complete Binary Tree Representation
    An array, where for each vertex, k,
    its left child is at index 2k and its 
    right child is at index 2k+1

Preserving the Heap Property
    If we want to add an element to a heap, we cannot
    do so at random: we must somehow preserve the heap
    property.

The shifting of vertices up the tree is called "up-heap". 

Insert Algorithm:
    1. Insert new vertex in the left-most open spot at the bottom of the tree
    2. Repeatedly swap the vertex and its parent, until the vertex is larger
       than the parent.
This operation will, at worst, run in log(n).

How about removing the root element? We'll replace it with the last vertex,
and then correct the tree by swapping the vertex down.

We must always swap with the smallest child vertex to ensure we don't
create any new Heap Property violations.

The shifting of vertices down the tree is called "down-heap".

Remove Root Algorithm:
    1. Remove the root vertex and replace it with the last vertex in the tree
    2. Repeatedly swap the moved vertex with the smaller of its children, until
       it is smaller than all its children (or becomes a leaf)
This operation will again, at worst, run in log(n).

Other Operations:
    • Search for element
    • Delete arbitrary element
    • Modify element value
But we won't talk about these explicitly.

Okay, let's check out some code!
